/**
 * Resolve and read a sibling asset (markdown, prompt section, etc.) relative
 * to the caller's compiled location.
 *
 * The root build uses tsup with `bundle: false`, so every source file is
 * emitted as a standalone module that mirrors the `src/` layout. That means a
 * caller in `src/modules/<name>/foo.ts` resolves to:
 *   - Production:                dist/modules/<name>/foo.js
 *   - Dev (tests against src):   src/modules/<name>/foo.ts
 * Asset siblings (e.g. `agents/`, `commands/`, `prompt-sections/`) are copied
 * into the same dist layout by `scripts/copy-root-assets.mjs`, so the SAME
 * `relativePath` works in both dev and production.
 *
 * If a read fails it means the build asset-copy step is broken or someone
 * moved the assets — fix the layout, not the resolver.
 *
 * Assets are build-time-immutable bundle artifacts that never change for the
 * lifetime of the process, so successful reads are memoized permanently and
 * keyed by the fully-resolved absolute path. Two callers resolving to the same
 * file therefore share a single cache entry. Failed reads are NOT cached.
 *
 * @param callerUrl    Pass `import.meta.url` from the caller.
 * @param relativePath Path to the asset, relative to the caller's directory.
