/**
 * Cross-module wiring for `dispatch_parallel`.
 *
 * The coordinator module owns `dispatchParallel(...)` — the pool, the poller,
 * the abort plumbing. But two pieces of behaviour are owned by other modules:
 *
 *   - The QA plugin owns `SessionAgentRegistry` (so the `shell.env` hook can
 *     resolve `childSessionID → agent name`), and a scrubber that redacts known
 *     secret values from specialist results.
 *   - The QA plugin also owns the bindings-parsing entry point (the QA plan's
 *     `## Setup` → `**Bindings:**` section gets parsed into `QaRunState` so
 *     `execute_recipe` can find recipes by name).
 *
 * If the coordinator imported `../qa/*` directly we would invert the layering:
 * the orchestration module would depend on a feature module. Instead this
 * module is a write-once registry that the QA plugin populates at startup,
 * and the coordinator reads from at `dispatch_parallel` execute time.
 *
 * The QA plugin owns lifetime: it constructs the singletons, registers them
 * here, and clears them inside its own `session.deleted` handler. The
 * coordinator is read-only.
 *
 * Test discipline: each module's unit tests must NOT touch this singleton.
 * Use the `*Hook`s parameters directly (the coordinator's `dispatchParallel`
 * already takes `sessionAgentRegistry`, `scrubber`, `parentSessionID` as
 * inputs — this module is only the wiring at the plugin boundary).

/**
 * Hook invoked by `dispatch_parallel` BEFORE any specialist session is spawned
 * for a given parent (Perun) session. The QA plugin uses this to lazily parse
 * the plan's `**Bindings:**` section and call `QaRunState.storePlan(...)` so
 * that `execute_recipe` can subsequently find recipes by name.
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   - MUST be idempotent — `dispatch_parallel` may fire multiple waves for the
 *     same parent session.
 *   - MUST NOT throw — wrap errors and swallow; a bindings-parse failure must
 *     not break unrelated QA dispatches.
 *   - MUST resolve before any task is started — the bindings need to be in
 *     `QaRunState` BEFORE the first `zmora-setup` task calls `execute_recipe`.
 *
 * Receives the parent session ID so the QA plugin can scope state by parent.
 * Receives the array of task names so the hook can short-circuit when none of
 * the tasks are zmora-setup (no bindings work to do).
