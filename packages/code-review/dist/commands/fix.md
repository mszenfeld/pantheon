description: Apply fix for a single code review issue with verification and reporting.
argument-hint: <issue-id | full issue block from /review report>
---

## Input Handling

Parse the input argument to determine mode:

- **ID Mode:** If `$ARGUMENTS` matches pattern `^(SEC|PERF|ARCH|MAINT|DOC|QA)-\d{3}$`
  - Examples: `SEC-001`, `PERF-042`, `ARCH-001`, `MAINT-999`, `DOC-001`, `QA-001`
  - Action: Proceed to Phase 0 (Resolve Issue by ID)

- **Legacy Paste Mode:** If `$ARGUMENTS` does not match the ID pattern (e.g., contains `### [` or other issue block content)
  - Action: Skip Phase 0, proceed directly to Phase 1 (Parse Issue) with input as-is

This allows backward compatibility: both ID lookup and issue block pasting work.

# Fix Code Review Issue

You are an expert code fixer that takes a single issue from a code review report and performs a complete fix cycle: analysis, proposal, implementation, verification, and reporting.

## Input

The user provides either an issue ID or an issue block from `/review`:

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Phase 0: Resolve Issue by ID (ID mode only)

**ONLY execute this phase if `$ARGUMENTS` matches the ID pattern from Input Handling above.**

**Skip this phase entirely if in Legacy Paste Mode.**

### Step 0.1: Locate most recent report

The target directory depends on the issue's prefix:

- `QA` → `docs/testing/reports/`
- `SEC`, `PERF`, `ARCH`, `MAINT`, `DOC` → `docs/reviews/`

Extract the prefix from `$ARGUMENTS` (the substring before the first `-`) and list the newest `.md` file in the chosen directory:

```bash
prefix=$(echo "$ARGUMENTS" | cut -d'-' -f1)
case "$prefix" in
  QA) target_dir="docs/testing/reports" ;;
  *)  target_dir="docs/reviews" ;;
esac
ls -t "$target_dir"/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Expected: The most recently modified file in the chosen directory.

If no files found, display an error and stop. The message is prefix-specific:

- `QA` prefix:
  > Error: No saved QA reports found in `docs/testing/reports/`. Run `/qa:run` first, then use `/fix QA-001`.

- Other prefixes:
  > Error: No saved review reports found in `docs/reviews/`. Run `/review` and save a report first, then use `/fix <ID>`.

**Note on out-of-band edits:** Routing is one-way per prefix. A `QA-XXX` issue manually moved into `docs/reviews/` will not be reachable via `/fix QA-001`. Workaround: legacy paste mode (`/fix <full block>`).

### Step 0.2: Read the report file

Use the Read tool to read the most recent report file identified in Step 0.1.

Store the report file path for use in Phase 8.

### Step 0.3: Search for the issue by ID

Scan the report for a heading containing the provided ID.

Search for a line matching: `### [` followed by a severity level, followed by `] {ID}:` where `{ID}` is the ID from `$ARGUMENTS`.

Example: If user provided `SEC-001`, search for headings like:

- `### [HIGH] SEC-001: SQL Injection...`
- `### [CRITICAL] SEC-001: ...`
- `### [HIGH] QA-001: POST /api/users returns 500...`

### Step 0.4: Extract the full issue block

Once found, extract the complete issue block:

- **Start:** the `### [SEVERITY] ID: Title` line
- **End:** the next `###` heading, or `---` separator, or end of file

This extracted block becomes the input for Phase 1.

### Step 0.5: Handle not found

If the ID is not found in the report, display error and stop:

> Error: Issue `{ID}` not found in report: `{report-path}`
>
> Available issues in this report:
> {list all issue IDs found in the report, e.g., SEC-001, SEC-002, PERF-001}
>
> Use `/fix <paste issue block>` to fix using the full block, or check the report path.

### Step 0.6: Proceed to Phase 1

Pass the extracted issue block to Phase 1 as if it were the original `$ARGUMENTS`.

The remainder of the fix workflow (Phases 1-7) operates normally, unaware of whether the input came from ID lookup or direct paste.

---

## Phase 1: Parse Issue

**FIRST: Create all progress tasks using the `todowrite` tool:**

- [ ] Parse issue
- [ ] Analyze context
- [ ] Propose fix
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Verify fix
- [ ] Generate report
- [ ] Update report (only if in ID mode)

**After creating all tasks:** Mark "Parse issue" as in progress using `todowrite`.

Extract the following fields from the issue block:

| Field | Pattern | Required |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Severity | `[CRITICAL\|HIGH\|MEDIUM\|LOW]` in title | Yes |
| Title | Text after severity in first line | Yes |
| Location | `**Location:** \`path:line\`` | Yes |
| Category | `**Category:** Security\|Performance\|Architecture\|Maintainability\|Documentation\|Testing` | Yes |
| OWASP | `**OWASP:** A##:####` | No |
| CWE | `**CWE:** CWE-###` | No |
| Effort | `**Effort:** trivial\|easy\|medium\|hard` | No |
| Problem | Text after `**Problem:**` | Yes |
| Impact | Text after `**Impact:**` | No |
| Remediation | Text after `**Remediation:**` (including code blocks) | Yes |

**If required fields are missing:**

Use the `question` tool:
- question: "Required issue fields are missing. Please provide the location (file path and line number), problem description, and remediation suggestion."

**Store parsed data mentally for next phases.**

**Task Update:** Mark "Parse issue" as completed and "Analyze context" as in progress using `todowrite`.

---

## Phase 2: Analyze Context

**Step 2.1: Read target file**

Use Read tool to read the file at the parsed Location. Focus on:

- The specific line(s) mentioned in the issue
- The function/method/class containing the issue
- 20-30 lines of surrounding context

**Step 2.2: Understand the code structure**

Identify:

- What function/class contains the issue
- What the code is trying to accomplish
- Input sources and data flow
- Related error handling

**Step 2.3: Check related files (if needed)**

If the issue involves:

- Imports → check imported modules
- API calls → check API definitions
- Database → check models/schemas
- Tests → check existing test files

Use Glob and Read tools as needed.

**Step 2.4: Note project patterns**

Look for:

- Similar code elsewhere that handles this correctly
- Project coding standards (if visible)
- Existing patterns for the type of fix needed

**Step 2.5: Detect stack and load developer skills**

Before proceeding, detect the project tech stack:

1. Check for Python project markers:
   - `pyproject.toml` exists
   - `requirements.txt` exists
   - `setup.py` exists
   - `**/*.py` files present in project

2. If Python detected, load relevant python-developer skills:
   - `python-coding-standards` (always)
   - `python-tdd-workflow` (always)
   - Check `pyproject.toml` dependencies for:
     - `fastapi` → load `fastapi-patterns`
     - `sqlalchemy` → load `sqlalchemy-patterns`
     - `pydantic` → load `pydantic-patterns`
     - `django` or `djangorestframework` → load `django-web-patterns` and `django-orm-patterns`
     - `celery` → load `celery-patterns`
     - `asyncio`, `uvicorn`, or `anyio` → load `async-python-patterns`
     - `uv` → load `uv-package-manager`

   Load each using the `load_appverk_skill` tool:
   ```
   Call the tool `load_appverk_skill` with name `<skill-name>`
   ```

3. Check for Frontend project markers:
   - `package.json` exists and contains `"react"` in dependencies
   - `tsconfig.json` exists

4. If Frontend detected, note frameworks for later reference:
   - tailwindcss, zustand, tanstack query, react hook form, pnpm

5. Check for PHP project markers:
   - `composer.json` exists
   - `symfony.lock` exists

6. Store the list of successfully loaded skills in `skills_to_load`.

**Graceful degradation:** If `load_appverk_skill` is unavailable, or no Python is detected, set `skills_to_load = []` and proceed normally. Stack detection is additive only.

Store the detected patterns for use in Phases 3 and 4.

**Task Update:** Mark "Analyze context" as completed and "Propose fix" as in progress using `todowrite`.

---

## Phase 3: Propose Fix

Present the fix proposal in this exact format:

````
## Proposed Fix for [SEVERITY] [Title]

**Target:** `path/to/file.py:line-range`

**Approach:**
[2-3 sentences explaining the fix strategy, incorporating the Remediation
suggestion from the issue and adapting it to the actual code context]

**Changes:**
1. [Specific change #1]
2. [Specific change #2 if needed]

**Code Preview:**

Current code (lines X-Y):
```[language]
[actual current code from the file]
```

Proposed fix:
```[language]
[the fixed code]
```

**Verification Plan:**
- [ ] [Tool 1] - [reason based on change type]
- [ ] [Tool 2] - [reason if applicable]

**Proceed with this fix? (yes/no)**
````

**Stack-Aware Proposals (if developer skills available):**

If developer skills were loaded in Step 2.5, incorporate their patterns into the proposal:

- **Python fixes**: Reference conventions from python-developer skills (e.g., "Fix uses `Annotated[T, Depends(...)]` per FastAPI patterns", "Fix adds `selectinload` per SQLAlchemy patterns")
- **Frontend fixes**: Reference conventions from frontend-developer skills (e.g., "Fix uses `zodResolver` per form-patterns", "Fix uses granular selectors per zustand-patterns")

This ensures the user sees that the fix follows project conventions, not just generic best practices.

**CRITICAL: Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding to Phase 4.**

Do NOT make any changes until the user confirms with "yes" or similar affirmation.

**Task Update:** Mark "Propose fix" as completed and "Implement fix" as in progress using `todowrite`.

---

## Phase 4: Implement Fix

**Only proceed after user approval.**

**Step 4.1: Apply the fix**

Use the Edit tool to make targeted changes:

- Use exact `old_string` matching for precision
- Preserve surrounding code and formatting
- Make minimal changes - only what's needed

**Step 4.1b: Apply developer patterns (if available)**

When implementing the fix, follow conventions from loaded developer skills:

**Python patterns to apply:**

- Use absolute imports (never relative)
- Use `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]`
- Add type hints to any new/modified functions
- Use `raise ... from ...` for exception chaining
- If FastAPI: use `Annotated[T, Depends(...)]`, proper exception mapping
- If SQLAlchemy: use eager loading strategies, Repository pattern
- If Pydantic: use `frozen=True` for value objects, `from_attributes=True`

**Frontend patterns to apply:**

- Strict TypeScript (no `any`, no `as` except `as const`, no `!`)
- If React Hook Form: Zod schema as single source of truth + zodResolver
- If Zustand: granular selectors, never destructure entire store
- If TanStack Query: queryOptions pattern, proper invalidation after mutations
- If Tailwind: cn() utility, semantic tokens, mobile-first

**Only apply patterns from skills that were actually detected. Do not force patterns from undetected frameworks.**

**Step 4.2: Handle multiple locations**

If the fix requires changes in multiple places:

1. List all locations that need changes
2. Apply changes one at a time
3. Verify each change was applied correctly

**Step 4.3: Verify changes were applied**

After editing, read the modified section to confirm:

- The fix was applied correctly
- No unintended changes were made
- Code still looks syntactically correct

**Task Update:** Mark "Implement fix" as completed and "Verify fix" as in progress using `todowrite`.

---

## Phase 5: Verify Fix

### Step 5.1: Select Verification Tools

Based on the issue and changes made, select appropriate tools:

| Indicator | Tools to Run |
|-----------|--------------|
| CWE or OWASP present | SAST (semgrep) |
| Category = Security | SAST + secret-scanning (if auth-related) |
| Category = Performance | Linter + relevant tests |
| Category = Architecture | Linter + typecheck + tests |
| Category = Maintainability | Linter only |
| Category = Documentation | Read modified doc + verify links/references |
| Change touches `password`, `token`, `secret`, `key` | secret-scanning |
| Change modifies type annotations | typecheck (mypy/tsc) |
| Test file exists for modified code | Run those tests |

### Step 5.2: Run Verification

**For Python projects:**

```bash
# Linter (always)
ruff check <modified_file> --output-format=text

# Type check (if types changed or Architecture/Security)
mypy <modified_file> --show-error-codes

# Tests (if test file exists)
pytest <test_file> -v

# SAST (if CWE/OWASP or Security category)
semgrep scan --config=auto <modified_file> --json
```

**For TypeScript/JavaScript projects:**

```bash
# Linter (always)
npx eslint <modified_file>

# Type check (if tsconfig.json exists)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Tests (if test file exists)
npm test -- --testPathPattern=<test_file>

# SAST (if CWE/OWASP or Security category)
semgrep scan --config=auto <modified_file> --json
```

### Step 5.3: Record Results

Track each tool's result:

- Tool name
- Pass/Fail status
- Error details if failed

---

## Phase 6: Auto-Iterate on Failures

**Maximum 3 iterations total.**

### If Verification Fails

**Step 6.1: Analyze the failure**

Identify:

- Which tool failed
- What the error message says
- Whether it's related to our fix or a pre-existing issue

**Step 6.2: Determine if auto-fixable**

Auto-fix these issues:

- Linter errors in the modified code
- Type errors caused by our changes
- Import errors from our changes

Do NOT auto-fix:

- Pre-existing issues unrelated to our fix
- Test failures that require logic changes
- SAST findings that need design decisions

**Step 6.3: Apply iteration fix**

If auto-fixable:

1. Analyze the specific error
2. Determine the minimal fix
3. Apply using Edit tool
4. Re-run only the failed verification tool

**Step 6.4: Track iteration count**

```
Iteration 1: [tool] failed - [brief reason] - [action taken]
Iteration 2: [tool] failed - [brief reason] - [action taken]
Iteration 3: [tool] failed - [brief reason] - stopping
```

After 3 iterations, proceed to Phase 7 regardless of status.

**Task Update:** Mark "Verify fix" as completed and "Generate report" as in progress using `todowrite`.

---

## Phase 7: Generate Report

Present the final report in this exact format:

~~~
## Fix Report: [SEVERITY] [Title]

**Status:** [STATUS_ICON] [STATUS_TEXT]

**Changes Made:**
- `path/to/file.py:lines` - [description of change]

**Verification Results:**
| Tool | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| [tool1] | [ICON] [Pass/Fail] | [brief details] |
| [tool2] | [ICON] [Pass/Fail] | [brief details] |

**Iterations:** [N] of 3 [if more than 1]

**Remaining Issues:** [if any]
- [Issue that couldn't be auto-fixed]

**Next Steps:**
- [Contextual suggestions based on status]
~~~

### Status Definitions

| Status | Icon | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| Fixed | ✅ | All verification passed |
| Partially Fixed | ⚠️ | Main issue fixed, minor issues remain |
| Failed | ❌ | Could not fix within 3 iterations |

### Next Steps by Status

**If Fixed:**

- Run full test suite: `[test command]`
- Commit when ready: `git add -p`

**If Partially Fixed:**

- Review remaining issues above
- Run full test suite: `[test command]`
- Consider manual fixes for remaining items

**If Failed:**

- Changes have been left in place for review
- Consider reverting: `git checkout -- <file>`
- Manual intervention recommended

---

**Task Update:** Mark "Generate report" as completed using `todowrite`.
If in ID mode (Phase 0 was executed): mark "Update report" as in progress using `todowrite`.

**Changes remain uncommitted for your control.**

---

## Phase 8: Update Report (ID mode only)

**ONLY execute this phase if Phase 0 was executed (ID mode).**

**Skip this phase in Legacy Paste Mode — there is no report file to update.**

This step marks the fixed issue in the saved report, so it won't appear again in `/fix-report`.

**Task Update:** Mark "Update report" as in progress using `todowrite`.

### Step 8.1: Determine fix status

From Phase 7 (Generate Report), the status is one of:

- **Fixed** — all verification passed
- **Partially Fixed** — main issue fixed, minor issues remain
- **Failed** — could not fix within 3 iterations

### Step 8.2: Update the report for Fixed status

If status is **Fixed**:

1. Open the report file (same file from Phase 0, Step 0.2)
2. Find the issue heading: `### [SEVERITY] {ID}: Title`
3. Insert immediately after the heading line:

```
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

Use today's date.

Use the Edit tool with:

- `old_string`: the heading line followed by the next line (e.g., `**ID:** {ID}`)
- `new_string`: the heading line, then `**Status:** ✅ Fixed (YYYY-MM-DD)`, then the original next line

### Step 8.3: Update the report for Partially Fixed status

If status is **Partially Fixed**, follow the same process as Step 8.2 but insert:

```
**Status:** ⚠️ Partially Fixed (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

### Step 8.4: Do not update for Failed status

If status is **Failed**, do NOT modify the report. The issue remains unfixed and will appear again on the next `/fix-report` run.

### Step 8.5: Confirm update

After editing the report, display:

> Issue `{ID}` marked as {Status} in report: `{report-path}`

**Task Update:** Mark "Update report" as completed using `todowrite`.

**Changes remain uncommitted for your control.**
