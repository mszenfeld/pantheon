Pantheon provides a coordinator agent that delegates work to specialists, a QA agent for executing test plans, and per-agent model configuration.

## Primary agents

| Agent     | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perun** | The coordinator. Delegates work to specialists (blocking or in the background so it can overlap exploration with its own work), computes dispatch waves with dependency awareness, and synthesizes results. |
| **Veles** | Planning specialist. Authors QA/work plans from a diff or request and returns the saved plan; it plans the work rather than executing it. `EXPENSIVE`. |

## Subagents

| Agent       | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zmora**   | QA tester. Executes FE and BE test scenarios on demand, dispatched by Perun.                                                |
| **Triglav** | Read-only codebase explorer. Maps structure and finds definitions/references/patterns; dispatched by Perun before planning. See [`docs/exploration.md`](docs/exploration.md). |

## Installation

Add to your OpenCode config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    "av-opencode-plugins@git+https://github.com/AppVerk/av-opencode-plugins.git#v0.4.0"
  ]
}
```

Restart OpenCode after installation or any config change.

## Commands

| Command           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/create-qa-plan` | Analyzes recent changes and generates a structured QA plan in `docs/testing/plans/`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `/run-qa`         | Executes the most recent plan via Perun — dispatches FE/BE scenarios to Zmora and aggregates results into `docs/testing/reports/`. Runs a preflight check on env vars, services, and databases declared in the plan's `## Setup` block (aborts before dispatch on missing items) and pauses mid-run with a resume prompt if a scenario reports `NEED_INFO`. |

## Configuring agents

Per-agent model selection lives in `pantheon.json`:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/opencode/pantheon.json
{
  "agents": {
    "perun":   { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-7" },
    "veles":   { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-7" },
    "zmora":   { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6" },
    "triglav": { "model": "opencode/claude-haiku-4-5" },
  },
}
```

> The model IDs above are illustrative — see **Recommended models** below for current picks, and run `opencode models` for the exact ID per provider.

### Recommended models

A sensible starting point per agent. Veles' pick comes from running the model-eval playbook (`docs/eval/playbook.md`; reports aren't committed to the repo); the rest are matched to each role's job. The provider is up to you — the same model is offered by several (`opencode`, `openrouter`, `anthropic`, …), each with its own ID.

| Agent | Recommended model | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Perun** (coordinator) | Kimi K2.6 | Plans dispatch waves, delegates, and synthesizes results — the most reasoning-heavy role. Standardized on Kimi K2.6, the planning/grounding winner from the Veles eval; a capable, reliable model matters here. |
| **Veles** (planner) | Kimi K2.6 | Eval pick across three Layer-1 scenarios — the only candidate to finish all three with the JSON contract intact and clean grounding (no hallucinated behavior, local infra, real DB columns). `EXPENSIVE`, so reliability and speed matter. |
| **Zmora** (QA tester) | GPT-5.4 | Drives FE/BE scenarios with heavy, structured tool use; reliable at executing scripted steps. |
| **Triglav** (explorer) | Deepseek V4 Flash | Dispatched many-in-parallel and in the background — favors a fast, cheap model. |

Set each in `pantheon.json` as `<providerID>/<modelID>` for the provider you choose (run `opencode models` to find the exact ID — it varies per provider). The full reference (locations, precedence, schema, FAQ) is in [`docs/configuring-agents.md`](docs/configuring-agents.md).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

**Required:** Bun >= 1.3.13.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

This project uses Bun exclusively. A `preinstall` guard rejects `npm install` and `yarn install`. See AGENTS.md "Prerequisites" for the rationale.

### Install + validate

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run build
bun run check          # all three at once
```
